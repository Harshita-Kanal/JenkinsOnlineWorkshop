# This file is a list of commands to follow while working through the jenkins workshop
# This file makes it easier to have a look at the commands I am running
# Pre-requisites : Jenkins.war and  JDK

# To install all the required plugins using plugin install manager
java -jar jenkins-plugin-manager-1.0.1.jar --war /home/sladyn/Jenkins/JenkinsWAR/jenkins.war --plugin-file plugins.yml 


#Jenkins on AWS

# Step 1 : Connect to aws instance
# I am using a centos system, you can use an ubuntu system as well
chmod 400 JenkinsWorkshop.pem      ----> Give permissions
ssh -i "JenkinsWorkshop.pem" centos@ec2-13-233-51-2.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com
# update the instance
sudo yum update
java -version
# install java
sudo yum install java-1.8.0
# Install wget
sudo yum install wget
# Download latest Jenkins code package
sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat/jenkins.repo
# Import a key file from Jenkins-CI to enable installation from the package
sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat/jenkins.io.key
# Install jenkisn
sudo yum install jenkins
# Start jenkins
sudo service jenkins start
# To fetch initial admin password
 sudo su -
 cd /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/
 cat initialAdminPassword
#  To stop Jenkins
 sudo service jenkins stop
#  To uninstall Jenkins
 sudo service jenkins stop
 sudo yum remove jenkins
 sudo rm -r /var/lib/jenkins
#  Install git ( It is important becuase jenkins uses it)
sudo yum install git


# Jenkins and Github integration

# Step 1 would be to download the github integration plugin
# Choose a github repository so that we can test it out in my case I have chosen sandbox as the repo
https://github.com/sladyn98/SandBox
# Click on the new item  and start by giving it a name 
# Click on the freestyle project and click ok 
# Next click on the github project and enter the link 
# Select git as the source code management
# Put in the repo url ending in .git
# Next we need to choose our build triggers
# Check GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling	and save the settings
# Go to github and click settings and add a webhook.
# It will ask you for your webhook url, so the webhook url will look something like this
#  http://13.233.51.2:8080/github-webhook/ we are telling jenkins to route it to the github plugin.
# Choose content type to application.json.

# Jenkins cli
# All the commands that you need are already included in the jenkins CLI section :) 
# Any help can be easily found out
